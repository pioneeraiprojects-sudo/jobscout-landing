    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: February 09, 2026</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>AI Proposal Writer for Upwork</strong> (the "Extension") handles user
        data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects and stores your professional profile information (Bio) locally on your device using Chrome
        Storage. This data is used solely to personalize the AI-generated proposals.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Processing</h2>
    <p>When you click "Generate Proposal", the Extension reads the job description of the current Upwork tab and sends
        it along with your stored Bio to OpenAI's API. This is necessary to generate the response. No other data is
        transmitted.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal data to third parties. We only share data with OpenAI (the service
        provider) to provide the core functionality of the Extension.</p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>Your Bio is stored locally in your browser. We recommend keeping your browser updated for maximum security.</p>
